# TargetCall

TargetCall is the first pre-basecalling filter that is applicable to a wide range of use cases. TargetCallâ€™s key idea is to quickly filter out off-target reads (i.e., reads that are dissimilar to the target reference.) before the basecalling step to eliminate the wasted computation in basecalling.

## Prerequisites

TargetCall requires minimap2 to be installed. Minimap2 can be installed via [Minimap2 (v2.24)](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2/releases/tag/v2.24)

## Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/TargetCall
$ cd bonito
$ python3 -m venv venv3
$ source venv3/bin/activate
(venv3) $ pip install --upgrade pip
(venv3) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
(venv3) $ python setup.py develop
```

## Usage

```bash
$ cd src
$ python targetcall.py ../sample_data/fast5/ ../sample_data/Monkeypox_virus.fasta TINYX011 ../sample_data/outputs/
```

## Provided Models

You can find all models listed under bonito/models/.

| Model Name  | Model Name in the Paper | # of Parameters  | Basecalling Accuracy |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| default  | Bonito  | 9739K  | 94.60%  |
| TINYX0111  | LC-Main*2  | 565K  | 90.91%  |
| TINYX011  | LC-Main  | 292K  | 89.75%  |
| TINYX01  | LC-Main/2  | 146K  | 86.83%  |
| TINYX2  | LC-Main/4 | 52K  | 80.82%  |
| TINYX3  | LC-Main/8  | 21K  | 70.42%  |
